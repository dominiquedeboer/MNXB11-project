# Entries from oldest to newest:

2025-10-23 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Cleaning up the raw data for temperature in Lund. 

	* Python code preprocessing.py.
	* Instructions how to reuse the code are added as comments. It is reusable for other datasets but certain variables have to be changed manually inside the code.
	* The cleaned data can be found at datasets/lund_cleaned.txt

2025-10-23 Ivana Varsányiová <iv1308va@student.lu.se>

	Cleaning up the raw data for temperature in Lund

	* Preprocessed the raw data in Google colab using Python and the Pandas library
	* Created file onlynumbers-smhi-opendata_1_53430_20231007_155558_Lund.csv, it is the original file with temperatures in Lund manually cleaned, so now it has only numbers in it and no words explaining the data
	* Created three separate datasets, date_list.txt, temp_list.txt and time_list.txt, each has the corresponding data, one entry per line, no semicoloms separating them

2025-10-24 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Cleaning up the raw data for rainfall in Lund. 

	* Python code preprocessing.py updated to work for the rain raw data
	* The cleaned data can be found at datasets/lund_cleaned_rain.txt
	* the unused raw datasets were removed

2025-10-24 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Implementation of code to plot the yearly average temperature against years. 

	* The header file include/temp_vs_years.h defines the class temp_vs_years
	* The functions are written in src/temp_vs_years.cxx
	* The examples in main.cxx were removed and the defined functions were called. 
	* The histogram was saved as a pdf under temperature_vs_years.pdf

2025-10-28 Dominique Iris de Boer <do6140de-s@student.lu.se>

	Implementation of code to plot histogram of average temperature on 15/02 against entries, for two periods.

	* The header file include/temp_given_day.h includes the class temp_given_day
	* The functions are defined in temp_given_day.cxx
	* Added the cxx file to Makefile
	* Added part to main to call on functions
	* Two histograms were saved as pdf's

2025-10-29 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	ChangeLog updated 

	* I added all the major changes that were made by me (Marie-Philine). 
	* Renamed the original changelog with examples to ChangeLog_example, this can be deleted later

2025-10-29 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Absolute paths were changed to relative paths in all documents

2025-10-29 Dominique Iris de Boer <do6140de-s@student.lu.se>

	Changelog updated

	* Added the changes I made to this file

2025-10-29 Ivana Varsányiová <iv1308va@student.lu.se>

	Implemetation of code to plot histogram of rainfall on 15/02 against entries, for two periods

	* The header file include/rain_given_day.h includes the class rain_given_day
	* The functions are defined in rain_given_day.cxx
	* Added the cxx file to Makefile
	* Added part to main to call on functions
	* Two histograms were saved as pdf's
	* Changed the rain_given_day.cxx in a way that implements third histogram that combining the two periods into one graph, also saved as pdf

2025-10-30 Kiam Persson <li8211pe-s@student.lu.se>

	Added polished code to plot a years average daily rainfall against years.

	* Added header include/rain_vs_years.h where the struct RainVsYear is defined.
	* Added sourcefile src/rain_vs_years.cxx where the function ReadAndDraw is defined.
	* ReadAndDraw reads the contents of a parameter file with each date and it's rainfall, and draws a histogram showing the average daily rainfall for each year.
	* Added call to ReadAndDraw in main.cxx, with datasets/lund_cleaned_rain.txt as parameter.
	* Histogram result saved in rain_vs_years.h

2025-10-30 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Added a standard deviation to the temp_vs_years class

	*The standard deviation for all the temperature values is computed for each year and added to the plot 
	*The plot without the standard deviation still exists. 

2025-10-30 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Updated main. Now all functions are called at once.


2025-10-30 Ivana Varsányiová <iv1308va@student.lu.se>

	Updated chanelog, cleaned up datasets

	* Added changes to this change log
	* Moved files date_list.txt, temp_list.txt and time_list.txt from the main repository to the datasets subrepository
	* Deleted file smhi-opendata_5_53430_20251024_082317.csv from the datasets repository

2025-10-30 Kiam Persson <li8211pe-s@student.lu.se>

	Clang-formatted the remaining sourcefiles

	* Formatted using the Google-style.
	* Formatted src/rain_given_day.cxx src/temp_vs_years.cxx and src/temp_given_day.cxx
	* Removed src/practice.cxx

2025-10-30 Marie-Philine Hebel  <ma3648he@student.lu.se>

	Updated ChangeLog and Workplan. 

	*I added my part of the Workplan (from Google docs) to the Worklan in this directory.
